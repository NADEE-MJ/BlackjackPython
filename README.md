# BlackJackPython
This is a blackjack game based off the classic version played in vegas casinos written in python using the pygames module for the GUI. This was written for Hack-cade 2021. 

## Main Features
1. Fully customizable set of classes for card, deck, and hand that can be configured for any type of card game. 
2. Main game functionality for blackjack in both TUI and GUI versions.

## Playing the Game (GUI)
The game will first deal the player and dealer two cards with one of the dealers cards face down. The player has the option to hit or stay then after either busting or staying the players cards will be compared against the dealers cards. The dealer will automatically hit until their hand is greater than 16. Depending on the outcome a message will be displayed saying you win/lose/bust.

## Playing the game (TUI)
The game will deal two cards to the player, they can hit or stay. Once the player busts or stays then their cards are compared to the dealers cards. The dealer will automatically hit until their hand is greater than 16. Depending on the outcome a message will be displayed saying you win/lose/bust.

## Would Like to Add
1. Gambling system
2. Ability to split when given two of the same card
3. More intuitive/friendly GUI ie. better animations and better input methods
